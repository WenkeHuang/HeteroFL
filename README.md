# Hetergeneous Federated Learning
Benchmark for Hetergeneous Federated Learning by [MARS](https://marswhu.github.io/index.html) Group at the [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), led by [Prof. Mang Ye](https://marswhu.github.io/index.html).

## Research 

### Federated Learning with Domain Shift 

Rethinking Federated Learning with Domain Shift: A Prototype View - CVPR 2023 [[Code](https://github.com/WenkeHuang/RethinkFL)]
- We handle federated learning with domain shift from the prototype view.

Learn from Others and Be Yourself in Heterogeneous Federated Learning - CVPR 2022 [[Link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Huang_Learn_From_Others_and_Be_Yourself_in_Heterogeneous_Federated_Learning_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)][[Code](https://github.com/WenkeHuang/FCCL)]
- We investigate heterogeneity problems and catastrophic forgetting in federated learning.

### Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Graph 

Federated Graph Semantic and Structural Learning - IJCAI 2023 
- We handle federated graph learning from node-level semantic and graph-level structure.

### Federated Learning with Data Noise
Robust Federated Learning With Noisy and Heterogeneous Clients - CVPR 2022 [[Link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Fang_Robust_Federated_Learning_With_Noisy_and_Heterogeneous_Clients_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)][[Code](https://github.com/fangxiuwen/robust_fl)]
- We deal with robust federated learning with noisy and heterogeneous clients


### Federated Learning with Few-Shot
Few-Shot Model Agnostic Federated Learning - ACMMM 2022 [[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3503161.3548764)]
- We study a challenging problem, namely few-shot model agnostic federated learning.
